# colorful-personal-landing

Create a single-page landing page for Martin McGloin with copy and placeholder images. The domain is martinmcgloin.com and it the personal website of the product leader, podcast host of Praktisk PropTech, former Product Director at Airthings and a PropTech Norway enthisiastic.

The design should be modern and minimalistic, but with a splash of colour and personality. It should come across as professional, but with an identity.  The landing page should have a fun and inviting tone.

The page should showcase and link to the various activities and projects I am engaged with and finish with a CTA asking people to get in touch - my email is martin @ martinmcgloin.com

The projects to showcase with an image and a small blurb with a link should be: 

Praktisk PropTech - the PropTech podcast in Norwegian co-hosted with Tommy Hagenes. praktiskproptech.com (Martin McGloin og Tommy Hagenes er lidenskapelig opptatt av Ã¥ avmystifisere eiendomsteknologi og senke barrierer for Ã¥ komme i gang med Ã¥ utnytte IoT, sensorteknologi og de nye digitale verktÃ¸yene, samt mÃ¥tene Ã¥ utforske data om bygningene vÃ¥re. Det er gjennom Ã¥ samle inn mer data om bygningene vÃ¥re, og presentere handlingsbar innsikt pÃ¥ en forstÃ¥elig mÃ¥te som vi gjÃ¸r at vi kan oppfylle en visjon om mer bÃ¦rekraftige og sunnere bygninger.)

Injecting a breath of fresh tech into the world of HVAC, one UltraLink VAV damper at a time. In my unique role, I fuse humor with expertise to elevate indoor air quality and champion energy efficiency. I talk, breathe, and even dream of indoor air quality and energy efficiency.

My mantra? "No building should suffer with wasteful CAV â€” every structure deserves the energy-efficient embrace of DCV!"
